# KerogenDecomposition
Numerical simulation of Kerogen decomposition in an oil shale reservoir. 
The initial decomposition consists of kerogen --> Shale Oil
the objective of this research is the adaptation of this program https://github.com/geo-mech/hydrate or https://gitee.com/geomech/hydrate, which is a seepage and thermal model for hydrate reservoir, to the in-situ conversion process in Oil shale reservoirs with high kerogen content.
The result of this model are published at https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/13/5007
